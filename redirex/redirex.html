<h2>Redirect HTTP Requests to New Web Server</h2>
</center>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

There are few better ways to appreciate the breadth of the Web and the depth
of its content as to move a Web server from one machine to another
with a different IP address.  Whatever the reason
motivating the change, you'll quickly discover that requests continue to rain
onto the obsolete server, diminishing ever so slowly only as other
webmasters discover and correct broken links to your site, and search
engines eventually discover the change and re-index your site at its new
location.  <b>Redirex</b> is a utility which can smooth the transition
of a Web site from one server to another, both for users of the site
and its administrators.  Redirex is a <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>
program which receives
requests at the address of the old server and responds with HTTP
"redirect" (301 status code) replies indicating the new server's name.

<h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>

To install and configure Redirex, perform the following steps.

<p>
<ol>
<li>    Download the Redirex source archive and extract its contents
        into a new directory.  The archive contains <tt>redirex</tt>,
        the main Perl script and <tt>redirex.conf</tt>, its configuration
        file.
<p>
<li>    Edit <tt>redirex.conf</tt> and set the configuration
        variables appropriately for your application.  The
        configuration variables are discussed in detail below.
<p>
<li>    (Optional)  Test Redirex by running it on a user port
        (for example, 9080), then accessing it from your Web
        browser with a URL like: "http://my.hostname.net:9080/whatever.html".
        Verify that the request was redirected as specified
        by the configuration file.
<p>
<li>    Install Redirex on the old server, configured to listen
        to the port (usually 80) on which that server used to accept
        HTTP requests.  If the old server no longer exists,
        configure a different machine to respond to the old
        server's IP address, perhaps using "IP aliases" or
        "logical interfaces" to make an existing machine
        respond to the old server's address.  This is
        discussed in more detail below in the "Virtual
        Host Setup" section.
<p>
<li>    Verify that Redirex is correctly redirecting requests
        to the old server and writing log items to the
        configured file.
</ol>

<h3>Command Line Options</h3>

Usually Redirex is run with no options on the command line;
in this case it obtains all its configuration parameters
from the default configuration file, <tt>redirex.conf</tt>.
You can specify a different configuration file or cause
Redirex to listen for HTTP requests on a different port
by specifying the following options.

<p>
<dl compact>
<dt><b>-c</b> <em>conffile</em>
<dd>    Redirex will read its configuration parameters from the
        specified <em>conffile</em> instead of the default,
        <tt>redirex.conf</tt>.  This is handy if you wish to
        run several copies of Redirex to field requests for
        multiple servers; each copy can be started
        with a configuration file corresponding to the
        server it is to redirect.
<p>
<dt><b>-p</b> <em>port</em>
<dd>    Redirex will listen on the specified <em>port</em>
        instead of the port given in the configuration file.
        This permits testing Redirex with ports above
        1024 which don't require root (superuser) privilege
        without the need to edit the configuration file.
</dl>

<h3>Configuration File Variables</h3>

The following variables are defined in the configuration
file.  By default, the configuration is read from
<tt>redirex.conf</tt>, but you can specify a different
configuration file with the <b>-c</b> option on the
command line.  The configuration file is a Perl
program in its own right; specifications in the file must
conform to valid Perl syntax.

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>$defaultport</b>
<dd>This specifies the port number on which to listen for HTTP
    requests.  The standard port for HTTP requests is 80.  Note
    that to bind to any port with a number less than 1024, Redirex
    must be run with root (super-user) privilege; for testing use
    a port accessible to regular users (for example 9080), and
    specify that port in URLs to exercise Redirex.  After you're
    sure everything is working correctly, change the port number
    to the standard 80 and run Redirex as super-user.
    If the <b>-p</b> command line option is specified,
    this value will not be used.

<p>
<dt><b>$IPlisten</b>
<dd>This variable specifies which IP address to listen to,
    in dotted decimal notation, for example '192.168.37.252'.  If you
    wish to listen to all IP addresses, set this to '0.0.0.0'.  Note
    that if you specify a value of '0.0.0.0', Redirex will intercept
    <em>all</em> requests on the configured port for all IP addresses
    on which the system running it listens.  If the machine running
    Redirex also acts as a Web server, you'll have to specify the
    explicit IP address on which Redirex will listen.  If you need to
    run two or more copies of Redirex on a machine which is also a Web
    server, you'll need to prepare a separate configuration file for
    each server you're redirecting and start one copy Redirex for
    each, specifying the configuration file with the <b>-c</b> command
    line option.

<p>
<dt><b>$newServer</b>
<dd>This variable gives the URL prefix consisting of the protocol,
    host name, and (optionally) port number of the new server to which
    requests are being redirected.  Redirex assumes the new server
    has the same content (or a superset thereof) and directory structure
    as the server it is redirecting; the file name portion of the
    URL is simply appended to the $newServer string.  For example,
    suppose Redirex is intercepting requests to port 80 at IP
    address 192.168.133.12, host name <tt>gnarly.oldsite.net</tt>
    and $newServer is set to <tt>'spiffy.newsite.net'</tt>.  Then the
    URL request "http://gnarly.oldsite.net/info/catalogue.html"
    will be redirected to "http://spiffy.newsite.net/info/catalogue.html".

<p>
<dt><b>$newHomePage</b> and <b>$newHomePageDescription</b>
<dd>HTTP redirection should be transparent to the user,
    simply replacing the requested URL with the new destination.
    Since some browsers may not correctly support
    redirection, the HTTP standard recommends that redirection
    messages sent in response to GET and POST requests (but not HEAD)
    include descriptive text and a hyperlink to the new destination
    URL. That way, if the browser fails to perform the redirection,
    the user can simply click on the link to access the new location.
    When generating this message, Redirex includes a link to
    the URL specified by $newHomePage with descriptive text
    $newHomePageDescription.  This should point to the home page
    of the new destination server.  If the redirection should
    fail due to changes in the directory structure from that
    of the old server, the user can use this link to find the
    home page of the new server.

<p>
<dt><b>$logfile</b>
<dd>Redirex logs all requests it redirects in the named
    $logfile, which should be specified as an
    absolute path name.  Log items are appended to the
    file, written in the "Common logfile
    format" used by most present-day Web servers.
    To avoid many time-consuming domain name lookups,
    numeric IP addresses are used in the log file
    instead of host names.  If you require host names,
    process the Redirex file with the <tt>logresolve</tt>
    program included with the <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache
    HTTP Server</a> or the <a href="../logtail/">Logtail</a>
    program available at this site.  Redirected requests show
    the redirection status code of 301.  The length of
    the reply is always 512, a reasonable approximation of the
    length of the redirection document.

<p>
<dt><b>$DOredirect</b>
<dd>If $DOredirect is set to 1, requests will be hard-redirected with a
    301 status code.  If zero, the reply will be a normal 200
    status document which informs the user of the redirection
    but doesn't request the browser to automatically divert there.
    Requests processed with $DOredirect set to 0 appear in the log
    file with a status of 200.

<p>
<dt><b>$No_cache</b>
<dd>If $No_cache is set 1, responses will include header items which
    suppress proxy server and browser caching of the the returned
    document.  This is handy for testing, since some browsers will
    otherwise cache a redirect and not display the document returned
    should $DOredirect be subsequently set to 0. In the interest of
    efficiency, you should set $No_cache&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 when you put
    Redirex into production.

<h2>Virtual Host Setup</h2>

If you can't afford to dedicate a computer to impersonate the
server from which you're redirecting, you'll need to configure an
existing host on your network to respond to the old server's
IP address(es).  (Dedicating a computer to running Redirex 
is not necessarily absurd; Redirex requires minimal system
resources, and many sites have one or more retired
PCs which are perfectly adequate to run Redirex under a
system such as <a href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a>.)

<p>

Traditionally, Unix systems associated a unique IP address
with each network interface; the only way to cause a host
to listen to multiple IP addresses was to equip it with as
many hardware interfaces as addresses.  Obviously, in cases
where a single server hosts a large number of Web sites,
this requirement was untenable--a large Internet Service
Provider might require thousands of network interfaces
to support all of their customers' IP addresses.  Most
modern Unix systems provide a mechanism which permits
receiving packets for multiple IP addresses on a single
hardware interface.  Unfortunately, each different version
of Unix seems to have invented its own mechanism for
accomplishing this.  To figure out how to configure virtual
hosts on your server, a good place to start is the
system's manual page for the <tt><b>ifconfig</b></tt> command.

<p>

Once you've managed to configure your server to listen on the the old
server's IP address, you need to make sure there's no conflict between
Redirex and any Web server running on the same machine.  Many Web
servers, including <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache</a>, listen
by default to Port 80 on all IP addresses received by the host.  Thus,
if you start the Web server first, Redirex will fail because the
address it wishes to listen on has already been assigned to the Web
server.  To get around this problem, you must configure the Web server
to respond only to the IP address(es) it is intended to serve (use
"Listen" directives with Apache), then configure Redirex with the
$IPlisten variable set to the address it is to redirect.  If you need
to redirect more than one IP address, run a separate copy of Redirex
for each, using the <b>-c</b> command line option to specify separate
configuration files for each server.

<font size="+1" color="#FF0000"><b>Absolutely no support or assistance of any kind whatsoever is
available for Redirex--you are entirely on your own.</b></font>
As should be evident from reading this document, while Redirex is
a small, simple program, the many varieties of Unix in use on
Web servers makes it impossible to provide a cookbook installation
procedure.  Getting Redirex to work requires system administration
skills comparable to those needed to install a Web server; if
you don't understand terms such as "IP address", "DNS", "ifconfig",
"netstat", "Perl", etc. you probably won't get very far with Redirex.

<h2>Bugs, Features, and Gotchas</h2>

Redirex is a Perl script.  In order to use it, you need Perl
5.6 or later.  If you need to use Redirex with an earlier version
of Perl, download
<a href="prior-releases/1.1/">Version 1.1</a>,
which is compatible with Perl 4.036 or later.  Version 1.1 requires
you to manually configure socket creation parameters, as these are
not included in the Perl library in these older versions.

<p>

Redirex has been tested only under various flavours of the
Unix operating system.  In order for it to work on other
systems (for example, OS/2 or Windows NT), the implementation
of Perl used to run it must include Unix-compatible networking,
fork, and signal facilities.

<p>

Redirex assumes the directory structure and file names on the
new server are identical to those on the machine being
redirected.  If you need more complex file name rewriting,
you're going to have to add it yourself.  (For complicated
redirection, you're probably better off installing
the <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache HTTP server</a>,
which includes extensive URL transformation and redirection
support.  Redirex was written to permit simple redirection
without the need to install such a relatively large and
complicated package.)

<p>

If you're running Redirex on a machine with limited disc space or a
stripped-down configuration (for example, a firewall host), note that
you don't have to fully install Perl on the machine in order to run
Redirex.  It's sufficient to copy an executable of the Perl
interpreter and the few modules it requires into the directory with
Redirex and start it with "<tt>./perl redirex</tt>".

<p>

Transfer lengths written in the log file do not represent the
actual byte count; they're always 512.

<p>

The only way to cause Redirex to transfer its log to a new file
is to kill Redirex, rename the log file, and then restart the
program.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

Redirex is derived from <tt>mhttpd</tt>--a small HTTP server written
in Perl by
<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/levanj/" target="_blank">Jerry LeVan</a>,
which in turn was inspired by
<a href="http://www.science.uva.nl/~bobd/" target="_blank">Bob Diertens</a>'
simple CGI
"Get" server for executables and Pratap Pereira's <tt>phttpd</tt>.
Redirex is a much simpler application than <tt>mhttpd</tt>, so much
of the code in the original program has been deleted in creating this
single-purpose redirector.  Luke Bakken ported the original Perl 4
code to Perl 5 syntax in "strict" mode. Naturally, any errors and
omissions in this program are entirely my own responsibility.
