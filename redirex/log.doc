                           Development Log

23 March 1998

Initial release, version 1.0.

13 April 1998

Added code to ignore EPROTO errors (errno code 71 on System V) in the
accept() call.  Redirex was dying two or three times a week with these
on the live redirector machine.

20 April 1998

Update release, version 1.1.

2 July 2004

Integrated new version developed by Luke Bakken, which updates
to Perl 5 syntax and compiles in "use strict" mode.  Version
number changed to 2.0.

14 July 2004

Restored configuration file mechanism, which had been removed
in the Perl 5 modifications (probably because setting variables
inside the configuration file requires declaring them as "our",
not "my").

15 July 2004

Added a $No_cache configuration variable which, if set to zero,
includes:
    Cache-control: no-cache
    Pragma: no-cache
in the response document header.  This keeps browsers from
caching a redirect, which can be awfully confusing when you're
changing things while testing.

Added a:
    require 5.6.0;
statement, as the program has been determined empirically
not to work on Perl 5.003 (at least on the SGI, which is only
place I still have a copy of it).

17 July 2004

Cleaned up Makefile, HTML documentation, and made a new logo image
compatible with a white page background.
