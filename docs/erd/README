====================================================================

Source files are in svn: 
  gratia/docs/erd/gratia-[version].dez

Images are not being maintained in svn.  Just in the twiki doc.

====================================================================
Using the erd diagrammer:

1. open it: "C:\Program Files\Datanamic\DeZign for Databases V4\dezign4.exe"
2. File --> Open project
3. select the .dez file to edit
4. Edit it.
5. 2 copies are saved: 
   - one with a change box in the lower left 
   - one without the change box (for show and tell purposes)

When done, you want to create a displayable image.  I have found that a
.png format works ok.
1. File --> export as image
2. uncheck all 3 items (shadows, white background and Selected objects ony)
3. select OK
4. select the directory you want to save them in 
5. In the "Save As" window, select .png in the "save as type" pulldown
6. Use the same name as the .dez, except now it is a .png file
7. exit out

Then upload the .png to the Accounting twiki.
