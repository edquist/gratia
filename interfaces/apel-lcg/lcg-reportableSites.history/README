The files in this directory are a history of the configuration file 
containing the sites being reported and the normalization factors used each 
month.  

This allows us to rerun a prior months updates to the APEL database
insuring that we are using the same reportable sites and the normalization
factors used in that period.  Prior to this we did not have this capability.

This is, admittedly, a crude way of doing it but at least it provides the 
capability to recover.

The addition of these files new month will unfortunately have to be a manual
process.

The next step will be to change the LCG.py to use the file in this directory
for the month being reported.  It will also be changed to save the current
lcg-reportableSites file (which is what it uses today) in this directory up
until the last day of the month.  This guarantees the last one used is saved.

This also allows us to change the current months file for new sites and/or
normalization factors without affecting the updating of the previous month's
data.  This is a problem today.
