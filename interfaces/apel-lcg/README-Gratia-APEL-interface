Gratia - APEL/LCG Interface (John Weigand -2/25/2007)
-----------------------------------------------------

The intent of this whole process is to 

The following files are associated with this interface:
 lcg.sh
 lcg-all-dates.sh
 LCG.py
 lcg.conf
 lcg-reportableSites
 lcg-reportableVOs
 lcg-db.conf
 pswd-gratia
 pswd-lcg
 cron.sample

#################################
lcg.sh

The purpose of this shell script is primarily to get access to a mysql
client.  The mysql being used comes from Fermi UPS.  It assumes UPS is
available via /fnal/ups/etc/setups.sh.  There is no command line argument to
override this.  All other command line arguments are passed directly to
the LCG.py script which collects the data from the gratia database and updates
the LCG/APEL database.

This script is intended to be run as a daily cron process and should be run
a couple hours after midnight to insure that most of the previous days
accounting data has been reported.

5 02 * * *   dir=/home/weigand/gratia/cvs; cd $dir; ./lcg.sh \
             --config=lcg.conf \
             --date=current
             --update

This script will log error messages to stdout so it is important you do not
redirect stdout/err in the cron entry.  This will insure that someone gets an
email notification if a failure occurs.

It is also important that you 'cd' to the lcg.sh parent directory if you
specify relative paths for the various files in the lcg.conf file.

#################################
lcg-all-dates.sh

This script should not be run in its current form as the date range is
harcoded.  It is a utility script for easily running the lcg.sh script
for a set of months.  It should be reviewed ans modified as needed.


#################################
LCG.py

This is the script that does it all.  

In general and briefly, it does the following:
 1. Determines a 'nonmalization factor' using a specified probe as the
    base node.  This value is applied against the CPU and Wall time data 
    collected.
    - the probe used is defined by the 'NormalizationProbe' attribute of the 
      lcg.conf file.  This factor
 2. Retrieves the accounting data from the Gratia database for selected
    OSG sites and VOs for a month.
    - sites are defined in a file identified by the 'SiteFilterFile'
      attribute of the lcg.conf file
    - VOs are defined in a file identified by the 'VOFilterFile'
      attribute of the lcg.conf file
 3. Formats SQL DML INSERT statements to update the OSG_DATA table of
    the APEL/LCG database.
    - the table name is defined by the 'LcgTable' attribute of the 
      lcg-db.conf file
    - for testing purposes a clone table called OSG_TABLE_TEST can be 
      set instead.
    - the SQL DML statements for the last run are placed in a directory
      defined by the 'LogSqlDir' attribute of the lcg.conf file.
      The file name is YYYY-MM.sql and contains only the DML from the last
      update run.
 4. Updates the APEL/CLG database
    - In order to handle site and VO name changes, the SQL DML is set
      up to DELETE all data for the month/year and then INSERT the new data.
      This is a simple approach to handling these kinds of changes and works
      as of 4/25/2007.  It may be this will not hold up over the long run and
      will have to be re-visited.

Additional functionality:
  1. The script has been design to do everything EXECPT update the APEL/LCG
     database unless the --update option is used.  This prevents accidental
     running of the script especially when testing.
  2. Log files are creeted in the directory specified by the 'LogSqlDir'
     attribute of the lcg.conf file.
     - the format of the log files is YYYY-MM.log
  3. A file containing the latest SQL DML statements used to update the
     APEL/LCG database is created in the same directory as the log files.
     - the format of the sql file is YYYY-MM.sql

Usage:
  LCG.py(lcg.sh)  --conf=config_file --date=month [--update] [--no-email]

     --conf - specifies the main configuration file to be used
              which would be the lcg.conf file normally

     --date - specifies the monthly time period to be updated:
              Valid values:
                current  - the current month
                previous - the previous month
                YYYY/MM  - any year and month

              The 'current' and 'previous' values are to facillitate running
              this as a cron script.  Generally, we will run a cron
              entry for the 'previous' month for n days into the current
              month in order to insure all reporting has been completed.

     The following 2 options are to facillitate testing and to avoid
     accidental running and updating of the APEL/LCG database and are
     therefore considered optional:

     --update - this option says to go ahead and update the APEL/LCG database.
                If this option is NOT specified, then everything is executed
                EXCEPT the actual updating of the database.  The SQL DML
                file used to update the database will be created.

     --no-email - this option says to turnoff the sending of email
                notifications on failures and successful completions.

lcg.conf

Main configuration file.  

Format: It is a simple name/value pair with whitspece as the delimiter, 
        2 tokens only.
        Lines starting with '#' indicate a comment line
        Empty lines are permitted

  SiteFilterFile....... File with list of sites to be reported 
                        (lcg-reportableSites)
  VOFilterFile......... File with list of VOs to be reported 
                        (lcg-reportableVOs)
  DBConfFila........... Configuration file for databases 
                        (lcg-db..conf)
  LogSqlDir............ Directory for log files and the sql dml update file.
                        
 
  NormalizationProbe... Probe name to calculate the normalization factor
  NormalizationPeriod.. Number of periods (months) to use in calculating
                        the normalization factor.  The period will be a full
                        3 months when the run is made for any previous
                        period and from 2-3 months depending on the day the
                        process is run in a current month.
  NormalizationDefault. Default value to use if no data is available for the
                        NormalizationProbe (can occur at beginning of a month
                        and the NormalizationPeriod is <= 1, 
                        or if there is a problem with that probe)
 
  EmailNotice.......... It is suggested that this be gratia-operation@fnal.gov 
                        so a record of all transfer is available without
                        having access to the machine this runs on.

Note about add/change/delete of entries:  There is a global hash table in 
LCG.py called 'gFilterParameters' which is used to validate the entries.
This variable needs to be modifified for any changes.

#################################
lcg-reportableSites

This provides the list of OSG sites' accounting data to be pushed to the 
APEL/LCG database.  It is the CETable.facility_name of the Gratia database
and is the primary grouping.

Format: Only one site name per line
        Lines starting with '#' indicate a comment line
        Empty lines are permitted

       

#################################
lcg-reportableVOs

This provides the list of VOs' accounting data to be pushed to the 
APEL/LCG database.  It is the VOProbeSummary.VOName of the Gratia database
and is the secondary grouping.

Format: Only one site name per line
        Lines starting with '#' indicate a comment line
        Empty lines are permitted

#################################
lcg-db.conf

This provides all the necessary parameters for accessing the Gratia and 
APEL/LCG databases via the mysql client.  The only execption are the passwords
which are set up in separate files.

Format: It is a simple name/value pair with whitspece as the delimiter,
        2 tokens only.
        Lines starting with '#' indicate a comment line
        Empty lines are permitted

Below are the values used as of 4/25/2007.
There is an additional table available for testing called OSG_DATA_TEST.
It is a clone of the OSG_DATA table.

#################################
pswd-gratia
pswd-lcg

These files contain the respective passwords for the gratia and APEL/LCG
databases.  There are not many options for keeping passwords hidden in MySql
and rather than use the 'my.conf' file of MySql, the passwords are contained
here.

These files SHOULD NOT be put into CVS.

The format of the file is:
[client]
password="xxxxxx"

The location/file name  is defined in the lcg-db.conf file.  The names do
not have to be the same as defined here.
